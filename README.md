To continue receiving extension updates through an unofficial channel, please follow these instructions:

1. Go to More → Settings → Browse
2. Tap on "Extension repos" and then "Add" button at bottom
3. Input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seele-off/tachiyomi/main/extensions-list.json

This is an unofficial but open source community-maintained repository for the extensions. So, use at your own risk and do not ask for support in any official Tachiyomi socials. And again, a quick reminder that this channel is also NOT official.
